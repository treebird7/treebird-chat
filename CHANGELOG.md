# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **`gemma-bridge` crash storm** — unhandled `ERROR` result from `corrwait` caused an instant tight loop spawning hundreds of crashing node processes (114 in ~1 min observed on m5 at 3am). Added 10s backoff before retry when `corrwait` exits with error, preventing runaway crash reporting and CPU melt.

### Added

- **`treebird-chat-wizard`** — interactive 7-step session setup: name, location, transport (local / +smalltoak bridge), agent invite (numbered list of known agents + free-form), local LLM config (probes LM Studio for loaded models), discussion template (consortium / code_review / adversarial / brainstorm / blank), confirm + create. Writes the chosen template into the file, sets ACL, starts bridges, prints the join command.

- **`treebird-chat-session`** — non-interactive one-liner session creator. Creates `CONSORTIUM_<name>_<date>.md`, sets ACL for `--invite`d agents, auto-starts `gemma-bridge` if `gemma` is invited, prints `export CHAT=` + join hint. `--join` flag opens TUI immediately.

- **`gemma-bridge`** — local LLM bridge for treebird-chat. Watches a chat file for `@gemma` mentions using `corrwait`, calls any OpenAI-compatible local server (LM Studio, ollama, llama.cpp, mlx_lm), posts replies in flat format. 30-line context window, 20-min watchdog timeout (pure bash — no coreutils `timeout` required), stale-PID-aware single-instance lock. Configurable via `--lm-studio`, `--model`, `LM_STUDIO_URL`, `GEMMA_MODEL`.

- **`TREEBIRD_COLLAB_DIR` env var** — session and wizard default to `$TREEBIRD_COLLAB_DIR` instead of a hardcoded path. Falls back to `~/collab`.

- **Discussion templates** — four built-in templates in the wizard:
  - `consortium` — agenda, decisions log, action items table
  - `code_review` — risk checklist (security / breaking changes / large diffs / auth)
  - `adversarial` — proposer vs critic with arbiter rounds
  - `brainstorm` — open ideation with `[IDEA]` / `[CONCERN]` tagging

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-03

### Added

- `@mention` notification hook (`lib/mention-scanner.mjs`, `lib/watchlist.mjs`, `bin/treebird-chat-watch.mjs`, `hooks/treebird-chat-notify.sh`). Agents registered via `treebird-chat-watch add <file>` get a `systemMessage` injection on their next Claude Code turn when `@mentioned`.
- Self-content filter in `corrwait` — agent's own flat-format lines no longer trigger a wake.
- Persisted cursor sidecar (`<file>.cursor.<agent>`) — advances even when agent stays quiet, preventing replay of already-seen content.
- `treebird-chat-bridge` — smalltoak bridge for real-time cross-machine access without Syncthing.
- Flat format as the primary chat format alongside the legacy round format.
- Cross-machine end-to-end verified (m5 ↔ m2 via Syncthing).
- `treebird-chat-session` and `consortium` skills + templates.
- Timestamp preservation fix in bridge (was clobbering local-time `[HH:MM]` with smalltoak UTC).
- 23 tests for mention scanner, watchlist, and notification hook.
